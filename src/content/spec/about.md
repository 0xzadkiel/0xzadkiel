**Ola, I’m Zad𐌊𐌉𐌄𐌋 👋**, a **self-taught Cybersecurity student**.  
My main areas of focus are:

- **Red-Teaming** 🧠  
- **Exploit Development** ⚙️  
- **Network Exploitation** 🌐  

I'm passionate about offensive security, ethical hacking, and diving deep into systems to understand how they break — and how to secure them.

Currently learning through hands-on labs, CTFs, and open-source projects.  
This site is where I document my learning, projects, and thoughts.
