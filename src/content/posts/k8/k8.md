K8s, also known as Kubernetes, is an open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It is developed by Google and managed by CNCF. It's a container orchestration system which functions by running all applications in containers so the system updates and patches won't affect the applications as well as put security layers in place. 

Its used acorss industries such as : 
+ Devops
+ Machine learning
+ Etc..
 To automate development,scalling and management of containerized applications

# Internals 
K8s manages multiple containers via hierarchy system . 
+ `Container` : A isolated envoirnemnt where the the application resides and run 
+ `POD` : Includes multiple Containers inside it 
+ `Node` : Consists of one or multiple Pods 
+ `Cluster` : Includes multiple Nodes 


### Container 
A container is an isolated environment that includes dependencies and resources for an application to run properly unlike virtual machines. Containers don't include the kernel and use a host kernel, hence making them lightweight.

---

### POD 
In K8s, containers are part of a POD and there can be multiple Pods. The POD handles resources and communications of the containers. By default, containers in the same pod can communicate with each other. However, we can restrict that using an RBAC, an authorization system implemented in K8s. 

---

### Node 
There are 2 types of nodes in a K8s cluster 
+ `Master Node`
+ `Worker Node`

**Master Node**
The master node hosts the K8s `control plane` which serves as a management layer for K8s and is made up of multiple `system processes`. It manages things such as activities within the cluster and the overall state of the clusters as well as Schedule workloads and makes sure a desired configuration is maintained.`Control pane` is a collection of system processes that manage the cluster such as :

+ `Kube-Apiserver`: Exposes the k8s api; runs on port `10250` & `10255`
+ `Kube-Scheduler`: Assighns pods to nodes based on resources and constraints; runs on port `10251`
+ `Kube-Control-Manager`: Runs controllers to maintain cluster state; runs on port `10252`
+ `Cloud-Controller-Manger`: Manages cloud specific integrations
+ `Etcd` : Distributed key-value store for cluster data (Often runs as a pod instead of a sys process); runs on port `2379`for client and `2380`for peer communication


**Worker Nodes**
Worker nodes execute the actual applications, and they receive instructions from the master nodes and ensure the desired state is archived.
:::note 
When we install K8s on a system its considered a node.

### Cluster
Everything in k8s runs inside the cluster (`system process`, `nodes` etc .) and the `api` acts as a gateway between the outside/inside environment unless something is deliberately exposed via services, for example. 


**Cluster graph**
In the graph below is shown a `cluster` which includes a master node and multiple worker nodes (which include multiple pods.

# K8s API 
API is an endpoint provided by an application, so the end user can send instructions to it. It's like a control panel for an application with pre-defined options. The API defines things such as :
+ What a user will be able to control
+ How it will be controlled 
+ Communication formats and rules 

The `kube-Apiserver` is responsible for hosting `K8s api`, which is hosted on port `6443` and uses `https`.

### Objects 
The API resource serves as an endpoint that houses a specific collection of `api objects`. In `k8s api` these objects include essential elements such as : 
+ `Pods`
+ `Services`
+ Etc...

---

### Operations 
There are Operations that we can perform on the objects avaliable such as : 
+ `GET` Retrieves information or list resources 
+ `POST` Creates a new Resource 
+ `PUT` Updates an existing Resource
+ `PATCH` Applies partial updates to a resource (changes)
+ `DELETE` Removes a resource 

---

### Communication 
We communicate with the API by sending an `API Call` and receiving an `API Response`. When we communicate with k8s api using a tool such as `kubectl` to list available `pods`, for example, it can look like this under the hood :
```http
GET /api/v1/namespaces/default/pods HTTP/1.1
Host: <API-SERVER-IP>:6443
Authorization: Bearer <JWT-TOKEN>
Accept: application/json
```
The application receives the instructions and responds with the results . 
```json
{
  "kind": "PodList",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {"resourceVersion": "12345"},
  "items": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "nginx-pod",
        "namespace": "default",
        "uid": "a1b2c3d4"
      },
      "spec": {
        "containers": [{"name": "nginx", "image": "nginx:latest"}]
      },
      "status": {
        "phase": "Running",
        "podIP": "10.244.0.2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
:::note
We don't have to specifically use `kubectl` in order to communicate with K8s api. We can also use tools such as `curl` to do the same. What matters is the format of the request, authentication and client validation.
:::

---

### Authentication 
K8s supports various methods for authentication, such as `Client certificate` and `Bearer Tokens` using `authentication proxy` or `HTTP` to verify user's identity. Once the user is authenticated, K8s enforces authorization decisions using `RBAC` (Role-based access control). This technique involves assigning specific roles to `Users/Groups` or a process to determine which actions they can perform on which available resources.

**Anonymous Requests**
Every `worker node` in K8s runs a `kubelet`, a Mini-API usually on port `10250`that accepts the request from the `K8s API`. In older k8s distributions (pre`v1.14`), Kubelet is allowed anonymous access by default, meaning we can bypass the `K8s api` (Hence its verification and authentication rules) and directly communicate with a `worker node`. Any request made to the `Kubelet` without a valid `client certificate` is considered an anonymous request.

If anonymous access is allowed, it can be an issue because a `user/process` that can reach the `kubelets API`can make requests and receive responses which can reveal sensitive information.

Example of a request made to a kubelet to get list of pods using curl :
```bash
curl -k https://<NODE-IP>:10250/pods 
```

Anonymous request allows us to : 
+ List all pods
+ Read container logs
+ Bypassing K8s RBAC
+ Cluster Reconnaissance
And if the `kubelet` is misconfigured to allow the `exec` feature anonymously, even `RCE`.
To check if we are allowed to do remote code execution in a pod, we can use `kubelectl`, a client for
`kubelet`.

# Setting up k8s 
K8s can be deployed using various ways depending on our use case : 
+ `minikube`: Provides a single node and is fast,lightweight and easy to reset.
+ `kubeadm`: Can be used on both on premises or cloud
+ `Eks/Aks`: Used in Cloud Production environments, No infra management
+ `K3s/k0s`: Runs on low-power Devices 

**Requirements**
K8s can be deployed on `windows`,`linux` or `mac` and require a container engine such as `docker`,`containerd` etc ...

---
### Minikube 
We will utilize `minikube` to setup a local testing environment. Its perfect for personal use due to being lightweight and fast.

**Installation**
1. We get the `minkube` image
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
```

2. Install it using `install`
```bash
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

3. Execute `minikube` to start the cluster 
```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

**Setting up nginx**
1. Verify `minikube` is working using `kubelctl show pods ` and then we deploy nginx.
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:latest
```

2. Make it accessible 
```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

3. Verify that nginx is running 
```bash
minikube service nginx
```
