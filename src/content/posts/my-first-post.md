## 🧠 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the art and science of **protecting systems, networks, and data** from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.

But the real story?  
It’s about thinking differently. It’s about:

- Questioning assumptions 🔍  
- Exploiting the overlooked 💥  
- Breaking in to **build stronger defenses** 🛡️

## 👨‍💻 Who Are Hackers?

Not all hackers wear black hoodies.

There are categories:

| Type            | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🕊️ White Hat    | Ethical hackers, testers, defenders          |
| ⚫ Black Hat    | Malicious actors, cybercriminals             |
| 🟡 Grey Hat     | In-between — break things but don’t harm     |
| 🏴‍☠️ Script Kiddie | Newbies using tools without deep understanding |

## 💻 Your First Hack (Kind of...)

Let’s say you’re scanning a local network for open ports:

```bash
nmap -sS -T4 -p- 192.168.1.0/24
This command scans every port on every host in the 192.168.1.x network using a stealth SYN scan.

What you’re doing is reconnaissance, a core part of the penetration testing lifecycle:

🔍 Reconnaissance

🔧 Scanning & Enumeration

🚪 Exploitation

🧹 Post-Exploitation

📑 Reporting (Yes, you gotta write too)

🔓 Tools of the Trade

Tool	Use Case
🧰 Kali Linux	Full OS for hacking
⚒️ Nmap	Network scanning
🧬 Burp Suite	Web app pentesting
🧼 Wireshark	Packet analysis
🔐 Metasploit	Exploitation framework

🔥 Final Thoughts
Cybersecurity isn’t just a job — it’s a mindset.
If you think creatively, stay curious, and aren't afraid to fail forward, you'll thrive in this field.
